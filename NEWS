	Set PAM_RHOST to value of TCPREMOTEIP, which is set by
	tcpserver.  Thanks to dean gaudet.

	Use service name in syslog instead of hard-coded
	'checkpassword-pam' value.  Thanks to dean gaudet.

	New command-line option -H/--no-chdir-home: do not chdir to
	user home directory.  Useful in a specific case when home
	directories are automounted, but mail is being delivered to a
	central location.  Thanks to Christian Hudon.

	Updated to Autoconf 2.59 and Automake 1.7.9.

        Move chdir() after setuid()/setgid(), so that it works on NFS
        /home.  Thanks to Robert Holzwarth.

        Remove --stdin option, because manual testing could be done
        with a shell redirection.

        Provide RedHat-style checkpassword-pam.spec (courtesy
        sysadmin(at)sunet.com.au)

        Add PAM session patch from http://www.pjwstk.edu.pl/~bartek/

        Set $USER, $HOME, and $SHELL environment variables, to conform
        to checkpassword interface more strictly.  Patch from Stefan
        Aeschbacher.

        Fix Solaris compilation wrt to LOG_AUTHPRIV.

        Added --noenv (or -e) option, which disables setting up
        process environment, i.e. uid, gid, groups, home directory,
        and environment variables.  (Idea and original patch from
        Frank Benkstein.)

	Updated to Autoconf 2.57 and Automake 1.7.5
