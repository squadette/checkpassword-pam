.TH CHECKPASSWORD-PAM 8 "20 Apr 2002" GNU/Linux "Authentication"
.SH "NAME"
checkpassword-pam \- PAM-based checkpassword compatible authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
checkpassword-pam [-s PAM-SERVICE] -- \fIprog args...\fP
.PP
checkpassword-pam --help
.PP
checkpassword-pam --version
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B checkpassword-pam
uses PAM to authenticate the remote user with
.I checkpassword
protocol.

.PP
.IR checkpassword -style
programs are usually run by network server programs that wish to
authenticate remote user.

.PP
.B checkpassword-pam
uses PAM service name specified by
.B PAM_SERVICE
environment variable, or by the
.IR -s " or " --service
command-line option.

.PP
After successful authentication
.B checkpassword-pam
sets up supplementary groups of authenticated user,
its gid,
its uid,
and its working directory (those values are taken from the system
user database).

.PP
After setting up the process environment,
.B checkpassword-pam
executes
.I prog
with
.I args
as its arguments.

.PP
.I --
is used as usual to separate the
.B checkpassword-pam
own options from
.I prog
options.

.PP
.B checkpassword-pam
logs authentication failures (or all actions, if
.I --debug
option is used) to
.B syslog
(or to stdout, if
.I --stdin
option is used).

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B PAM_SERVICE
.B checkpassword-pam
uses contents of
.B PAM_SERVICE
environment variable to specify the PAM service name.  This could be
ovverriden by
.I -s
option, see above.


.SH "DEBUGGING"
.PP
You can turn on debugging using the
.I --debug
option.
.B checkpassword-pam
starts to log all of its actions and the results of those actions to
syslog (or to stdout, based on the state of
.I --stdin
option, see below).

There is a way to manually check that
.B checkpassword-pam
authenticates correctly: use the
.I --stdin
option.  With this option
.B checkpassword-pam
starts to read
.I checkpassword
protocol data from stdin, and log actions to stdout.  You can check
the authentication for the given user and password with the following
command-line:

.PP
.RS
$ echo -e "username\\0password\\0timestamp\\0" \\
.br
  | checkpassword-pam --debug --stdin -s SERVICE

.PP

.SH "BUGS"
.PP

.SH "LEGACY"
.PP
There are alternate checkpassword-pam packages available.  They are
derived from original DJB's checkpassword code, and are usually less
administrator-friendly than this version.  You can tell those packages
apart by looking at their version number: it is less than 0.95.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
This version of checkpassword-pam was written from scratch by Alexey
Mahotkin <alexm@hsys\&.msk\&.ru>
.PP
.I checkpassword
interface was designed by Daniel J. Bernstein.
